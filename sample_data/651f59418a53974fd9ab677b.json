A small part of the album is a little too experimental for me (e.g. the title track).  There are parts of the album that remind me of Bjork and parts that remind me of some Beatles (e.g. use of the horns reminds me of A Day in the Life).",

For example, \"Punk\", while being pretty catchy, sounds nothing like the rest of the album.  The songs with Del are probably the best.  I also really like Gravity.  But I don't think I'll be returning to this album much.",

I was more into GnR around the time they released the Illusions.  Agreed with others that it’s more like 4-5 great songs among filler.  They do have a very consistent sound throughout the album.  And I don’t know if Mr Brownstone is considered one of the greats but I love that song.",

I gather that for it's time this was a genre-defining album (drum n bass), which is something I respect but it's not a genre I spent a lot of time with.  I got some hints that are related to other music I'm a little more familiar with, like Morcheeba or Prodigy.  There were also some tracks that made me feel like I'm shopping at Banana Republic.  On the whole it was fine, but I'm not sure I'll be returning to this one.",

The closest thing I’m familiar with is Phish (I had a Phish phase), though Phish is more whimsical while Allman Brithers are more bluesy. To me this album makes for good background music - I can listen to it while working with no trouble. It’s kinda like baseball - when I’m at a game, I’m not really paying attention most of the time, it’s just there in the background. ",

But I didn’t really get into the “use the piano like a drum” style. It felt too constant/overpowering, and didn’t have enough style. Also, his singing is not as good live as Cooke’s. ",

The notes say that Lennon was into \"primal scream\" therapy at the time, and that clearly shows up in a couple of songs.  Interesting that it wasn't very popular at the time but has grown in importance over time.",

The general sound/production is OK.",

I didn't know the rest.  I like Andre 3000's voice.  The various skits/interludes were \"meh\".  I might get into this more if I give it another listen.  I'm also curious to try their other albums, especially Aquemini, since everybody in the group seems high on that one.",

I may be overly influenced by that :-) The album as a whole has parts that sound very 60’s and parts that sound modern even today. I listened to the full album, which included some alternate takes, and some of those sounded better than the originals, more to-the-point, which is not what I expect from alternate. ",

I also liked that instead of one soloist there were multiple instruments that took turns being prominent. ",

Cash is really good at working up the crowd (pandering?).  If he wasn't a musician, he could be a good standup comic.  I know several of his songs and I think they're fine.  But somehow it still doesn't rise above a 3-star for me.  The music is 100% Americana, which I appreciate.",

For me it has a couple of truly standout tracks (Son of Sam and Everything Means Nothing To Me), but the entire album is very solid.  Maybe not quite at the level of Either Or, but still amazing.",

This album was super long: 32 tracks and more than 2 hours.  Apparently it includes both the original album and a bunch of extras.  The band has the same hard-rock energy that comes up for the other grunge bands, but none of the songs really hooked me.",

I remember it was strange to get used to this more folksy style of Beck, as compared to the hip-hop/sampling/etc from his previous albums, but I ended up liking it just as much or maybe more.  Also interesting that my favorite tracks (e.g. Paper Tiger, End of the Day, Round the Bend, Little One) are NOT the most popular ones (Lost Cause, The Golden Age), though I like all the tracks on this album.",

I appreciate that Kendrick has more to say than just \"I'm all this n that\".  It's refreshing to see a successful rapper dissect his inner demons: guilt about using his success/influence to take advantage of people, or of neglecting his close relations, plus questioning what he even knows about life (after his trip to Africa).  The backing music is rich and varied.  I think I'll need more listens to really appreciate it.  Anyhow, I'm glad I finally started getting to know him as an artist because for me so far he's just been part of some headlines with his dis track battles with Drake.",

That context totally threw me off; I expected the album to be very different from what it was -- no punk/thrash, just a mellow mix of jazz and hip hop, with some tongue-in-cheek lyrics.  There are some really cool chord progressions, like in DUI.  I'd want to listen to this again.",

But the two albums have pretty different sounds (which I guess is not too surprising because they were also separated by 10 *years*).  What I like about Too High To Die is the tight harmonies and great melodies.  By comparison this album almost has intentionally amateurish sounding vocals and meh melodies.  I respect that Nirvana chose to play some of these tracks on their unplugged set, but I like Nirvana's take better.",

Anyhow, the album is OK.  Some parts remind me of Rolling Stones.  Some tracks have a throughline to newer stuff, like \"That's All You Need\" could easily be a Guns n Roses song.  Rod's voice used to bother me but now I kinda like it.  The album as a whole is OK.",

Some parts of the album sound related to Beck and other artists I like, and it sounds like they collaborated with Bjork and others.  I should spend time listening to their other albums.",

I think Walk of Life was how I learned the concept of sports bloopers.  The rest of the album is OK but nothing stands out too much (the title track almost rises).  The album is more world-sound and 80's than I anticipated.",
