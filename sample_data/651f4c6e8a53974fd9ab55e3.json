Elvis is the guy who's not dead from the cover of the Enquirers of my childhood. The singer of classic hits like 'Hound Dog,' 'Jailhouse Rock,' and 'Blue Suede Shoes.' I knew late-stage Elvis was a bit of a parody, but I didn't realize the parody kicked in so soon. ",

But the sentiment of that song feels wise and poignant compared to the super simple lyrics & storytelling of this album, which mostly seem intent on mimicking a teenage mentality.  It very much has a feel of adults trying to use modern slang and just making everyone uncomfortable when they do.\n\nPretty harmonies can't really make up for that, especially when that feels like the only tool in your toolbox.",

They're trying different things (sitar, music playing backwards), but it doesn't hang together the way you know their music eventually will.\n\nI'm also not sure how much each song is less of a collective effort and the album suffers for it. Paul is schmaltzy as ever ('Here, There & Everywhere' is monumentally bad), and it feels like no one dials back John's angst & cynicism (does anyone like 'Doctor Robert'?).  \n\nI had thought I liked this album more so it also might suffer from generally listening to Beatles in greatest hits form, where the mediocrity isn't as obvious.",

It's obvious she's more than capable of writing great songs, but it's also obvious she's not willing to really bear her heart, get personal, or SAY anything at all really...so it all just kind of blurs into a lyrically simple mish mash of ghosts and wine-stained dresses and tears and glitter.  Her music is safe, ensuring she offends no one.  But it's also boring.",

      "review": "Instead of modeling themselves on Tina Turner, it sounds like the other black woman Rolling Stones owe a debt to is Aretha Franklin given her gospel concerts influenced this one.  Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this (standout tracks for me were Sweet Virginia, Loving Cup, and the Ruby Tuesday feel of Let it Loose) - it's loose and rollicking in places, swaggering and fun in others.  But it also makes me want to listen to Muddy Waters, Ma Rainey, Bo Didley, Trixie Smith, Jimmy Reed, and on and on.",

Not bad, just certainly not timeless.  & probably appreciated it more when I was 15 instead of middle-aged.",

Stipe's voice is great, and the songs are that genre blend that came to define most of the 90s & beyond - twangy rocking folky melodic.  Very few misses & the gems (Pop Song 89, Orange Crush) really shine.",

Otherwise, was shocked to find how thoroughly 90s a lot of this sounds, even with Bjork's always amazing vocals - and doesn't necessarily hold up all that well.\n\nTo my ears, Bjork really let go of trends with Post, Homogenic and Vespertine, while staying within the parameters of typical song structure - (before she got really esoteric & jettisoned things like instruments entirely) and those 3 albums are much stronger for it. This one, while good, didn't really stand the test of time.",

      "review": "There was a magical day in my early 20s, when I was lucky enough to live abroad, that I spent with 3 other women paddle boating on the Vltava, cooking delicious dishes it never would have occurred to me to try to make at that time (bruschetta with eggplant?!), and listening to music in the fabulous apartment the host owned.\n\nShe was a little older, a little more worldly, she taught yoga as well as English as a 2nd language & she was *married*.  She put on this album while we cooked and laughed and hung out & maybe even danced a little bit like we were in some corny movie - and for an afternoon, I felt less like a broke expat who had no idea what they were doing with their life, and more like a sophisticated young woman living a fabulous life.

And maybe perfectly captures what it's like to walk around Capitol Hill on hot, humid nights, a bit giddy and a bit scared, but willing to give the whole love thing another try because how can you not?",

It didn't help that it mostly felt down tempo (except for maybe Staralfur and Agaetis byrjun.)  \n\nSoundscapes I can maybe do if at least they don't sound sad.",

      "review": "SO many hip hop artists are knee capped by success - which maybe shouldn't be surprising given how Black urban culture is essentially baked into the genre.  Either gritty authenticity gives way to out-of-touch commercialism (the best song on 'Life After Death' is still crappier than the worst song on 'Ready to Die'), earnest religiosity (there's no contest between 'Coloring Book' and 'Acid Rap,' see also West, Kanye), or the warping factors of fame and power combined with mental instability mean any artistic output takes a backseat to concerning antics (RIP ODB, see West, Kanye part two.)\n\nBut Kendrick Lamar not only avoids the pitfalls of power, fame, and success, he has the self-awareness to assess those things and find them wanting - or even burdensome. Whether his lyrics touch on survivor's guilt, imposter syndrome, the fear and reality of being exploited and the through line in American history of how that exploitation is baked into our culture - or, in keeping with the tradition of the genre, how insanely dope and talented he is - his output remains raw and real and also unmitigatedly Black. \n\nIn retrospect, To Pimp a Butterfly feels like just the beginning of Kendrick turning his focus to art & truth and giving a middle finger to commercial success.  While it maybe isn't as cohesive as Damn or Mr. Morale, it's still an amazing album with so many references (Ralph Ellison, Alex Haley, Wallace Thurman, breaking out of hip hop constraints to bring in jazz instrumentation) that lift up and reflect Black culture – simultaneously proving success doesn’t have to be a barrier to doing so, while also demonstrating just how and why that happens.\n",

I was either too knee deep into indie & folk at the time (Sufjan, Clap Your Hands, Joanna Newsom) and/or had started to have less time for scraping music blogs and Pitchfork reviews for new music.  In any case, I have no nostalgia for this since I didn't become aware of it until years later.\n\nBut even if my biggest association is the footage of Leonardo DiCaprio dancing like a kung fu fighting dad at Coachella in 2014, this still doesn't really do it for me--when it really should.  It's like a poppier Animal Collective or a less rocking Tame Impala - but even when the music is really catchy, they just make me think of LMFAO based on that album cover, and goofy Leo giving me serious cringe with his dancing.",

Though some of it is a bit too lo fi/sounds like it's being played through a tin can, the songs have great energy, enough variety to the sound (straight rock, a little twangy in places, rockabilly in others) and compelling (though note entirely catchy) lyrics.",

      "review": "I was first exposed to grime when I was living abroad, where British artists were much more pervasive on MTV and in clubs - and I remember it feeling like a revelation:  this spin on rap that felt utterly original, backed by beats that sounded like video games crossed with horror movies - but reflecting the same marginalized experiences and bravado-laden machismo that's so specifically hip hop.\n\nI have fonder memories of those early albums (Dizzee Rascal and Wiley specifically) than this output by Skepta.  Despite a few listens, only a few songs really hit.  There's ultimately too much repetition in sound & choruses, meandering skits that should have been left in the 90s, and mediocre lyricism (rhyming 'tender' with 'contender') to rate this higher.",

Swift and Lana del Rey, Melodrama still feels fresh and energetic compared to some of his latest output - the horn flourish on 'Sober' is 10x better than most of Tortured Poets Department.\n\nAnd Lorde is wonderfully Lorde, her sullen delivery giving the impression she's singing these songs against her will.  If the lyrics lean too much towards navel gazing self-loathing at times, even the songs that drag are listen-able - and there are enough bangers to raise this far above mediocrity.\n\n",

The bravado and juvenile humor is still there, but the constant refrain of violence and nihilism is so evident - pretty appropriate for an album titled 'Ready to Die.'\n\nAnd yet, even if the gangster rap genre as a whole doesn't entirely hold up, B.I.G.'s lyrical talent is undeniable, his wordplay so often matched by compelling, head-bobbing beats and samples.\n\nI might wish Puffy had been shot instead, but this album is still great.",

Like the Pixies, this feels shockingly modern for having been released in 1984, with a twangy, alt-country feel to some songs that strikes me as way ahead of their time - combined with dissonant singing that reminds me of Isaac Brock.  While a few songs lean punk, that's not the overwhelming majority of the album - and with the instrumental tracks, it feels like an early, funkier Calexico or something.  ",

It also felt a bit too 80s in parts, with horns that wore out their welcome.",

But this ultimately feels like him and the Family Stone mostly noodling and grooving - like we're listening to a jam session vs structured music (except maybe 'Family Affair' and 'You Caught Me Smilin').  While it's possibly a great example of funk, doesn't ultimately stick in a memorable way.",

While Elton might be just as skilled a songwriter, this album suffers from some serious bloat.  The only thing saving it is just how good the hits really are (Benny & the Jets, Good-bye Yellow Brick Road) that literally stayed in my head all weekend.  Only one other song I hadn't heard before caught my ear and beared repeated listening: Sweet Painted Lady.  Otherwise, this was a lot of piano prog filler around a couple of genuinely amazing songs.  Maybe more like a 3.5 to 3.75 but, I mean....B-B-Benny and the Jets.",

Sure, the music is catchy (if dated) with vaguely subversive lyrics - but I just don't *buy* any of it. Like, when PJ Harvey sings 'you leave me dry,' or Courtney Love screams 'when they get what they want, and they never want it again,' I *believe* it.  With Garbage's music, not so much.",

      "review": "This starts off so strong with the wistful 'So Far Away' -- then rapidly goes from mediocre to bad to 'I really want to skip this song' ear poison.  Hearing 'Walk of Life' so soon after the world-music aping nonsense of Paul Simon's Graceland did not win me over -- and then the awful 80s horn solo kicks in on 'Your Latest Trick.' \n\nIt's like everything good about their debut album got leeched away by the worst trends of the 80s.\n\n",

Otherwise, this sounds like it could be any other mid-to-late 70s asshat, throwing spaghetti at the wall (Soulful? Sure. Honky tonk? I guess.  Bluesy funk and some balladeering? Why not!)  Bonus - it's with a less than stellar voice.\n\nBut props to anyone whose wiki mentions having to buy rafts of penicillin for Manson family cult members due to the persistent gonorrhoea.  Way to shoot for the moon, I guess.",

The hits (Living for the City, Golden Lady, Don't You Worry About a Thang, ETC) far outnumber the few lulls.  While this might not be a sprawling masterpiece like Songs in the Key of Life, it's an insane run of memorable hits that make the whole thing a classic.",
